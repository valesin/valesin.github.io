    <h2>Academic Focus</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Computer Science undergraduate in my final year, with a strong focus on both the theoretical and practical aspects of the field. Throughout my academic journey, I have built a solid foundation in areas such as optimization, algorithm design, and the mathematical and theoretical principles of Informatics, while also developing the skills to apply this knowledge effectively to solve real-world problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, I am concentrating on Statistics, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Operational Research, as I work on projects and coursework that explore topics like predictive modeling, resource allocation, and decision-making systems. These areas align with my current goals and interests as I continue to grow my expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, I aim to expand into Computational Cognitive and Social Sciences, a field that fascinates me for its interdisciplinary approach and potential to address complex challenges across diverse domains. To prepare for this, I am independently studying Algorithmic Game Theory, exploring its applications in decision-making, multi-agent systems, and economic modeling. This direction reflects my curiosity and passion for leveraging technology to better understand intricate human behaviors and societal dynamics.

  <!-- Personal Interests -->
  <section>
    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Music composition and performance have been integral parts of my life. I have been playing the guitar for over 10 years and am currently studying Classical and Jazz piano. Composing music allows me to express creativity while balancing my analytical pursuits in computer science. I also compose electronic music using both analog and digital audio workstations, experimenting with sound design and blending genres to create unique compositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am passionate about maintaining bioactive terrariums, where I have been keeping two colonies of isopods in a self-sustaining environment for over 3 years. This hobby reflects my interest in ecology and sustainable systems. Additionally, I have rescued and care for a bearded dragon, providing it with a safe and enriched habitat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two writers I deeply admire are Umberto Eco and Hermann Hesse. Their books, especially <em>The Island of the Day Before</em> and <em>Siddhartha</em>, have been meaningful to me —in different ways— and have shaped how I think about life, spirituality, philosophy, and personal growth.
