<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf0dce49">
<p>
I am a Computer Science undergraduate in my final year, with a strong focus on both the theoretical and practical aspects of the field. Throughout my academic journey, I have built a solid foundation in areas such as optimization, algorithm design, and the mathematical and theoretical principles of Informatics, while also developing the skills to apply this knowledge effectively to solve real-world problems.<br />
</p>

<p>
Right now, I am concentrating on Statistics, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Operational Research, as I work on projects and coursework that explore topics like predictive modeling, resource allocation, and decision-making systems. These areas align with my current goals and interests as I continue to grow my expertise.<br />
</p>

<p>
Looking ahead, I aim to expand into Computational Cognitive and Social Sciences, a field that fascinates me for its interdisciplinary approach and potential to address complex challenges across diverse domains. To prepare for this, I am independently studying Algorithmic Game Theory, exploring its applications in decision-making, multi-agent systems, and economic modeling. This direction reflects my curiosity and passion for leveraging technology to better understand intricate human behaviors and societal dynamics.<br />

<h2 id="org3bdb648">Education</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3bdb648">
<p>
I have pursued a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Milan in Italy, where I maintain a GPA of 9.15/10. My coursework includes subjects like Formal Languages and Automata Theory, Mathematical Logic, Programming, and Discrete Mathematics (Linear Algebra). Other notable achievements span Continuum Mathematics (Calculus), Computer Architecture, and Algorithms and Data Structures. I expect to complete additional studies in Statistics (covering advanced probability models and Bayesian methods) and Operational Research (including linear programming, branching algorithms, and multi-objective optimization) by Spring Semester 2025.<br />
</p>

<p>
During Spring Semester 2024, I participated in the Erasmus+ Exchange Program at Vilnius University, Lithuania, where I successfully studied Signal Analysis and Processing along with Object-Oriented Programming. Through the 4EU+ program, I also engaged with several European institutions. At Sorbonne University, I explored AI from ethical and legal perspectives, aligning with EU guidelines and considering GDPR implications. Concurrently at Charles University, Prague, I am applying computational thinking and algorithmic problem-solving in education, influenced by pedagogical frameworks like Constructionism and Constructivism. My academic journey thus reflects a broad, interdisciplinary exposure to European educational environments and collaborations.<br />

<h2 id="orgf168ab2">Technical profile</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf168ab2">
<p>
My background in Foundational Computer Science Theory encompasses Complexity Theory (including P vs NP and NP-completeness), Automata Theory (covering finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines), and Formal Languages (ranging from regular expressions to context-free grammars).<br />
</p>

<p>
I have hands-on experience with various Algorithms and Data Structures, such as linear programming (e.g., Simplex), graph traversal and pathfinding (Dijkstra’s, A*), minimum spanning tree algorithms (Kruskal’s and Prim’s), dynamic programming, backtracking, and FFT. This is complemented by proficiency in core data structures, including graph representations, BST/AVL trees, heaps, union-find, and hash tables.<br />
</p>

<p>
My programming skill set spans both procedural (Python with NumPy/Pandas, Java, Go) and functional paradigms (OCaml, Scala, Erlang, Guile Scheme, Elisp). I also have a solid grasp of SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases for schema design, optimal querying, and overall performance tuning.<br />
</p>

<p>
As a practitioner of literate programming, I embrace Knuth’s methodology to integrate code and documentation cohesively. Leveraging Emacs Org-mode allows me to produce well-structured LaTeX and HTML outputs, enhancing transparency, comprehension, and maintainability in my projects.<br />

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Music composition and performance have been integral parts of my life. I have been playing the guitar for over 10 years and am currently studying Classical and Jazz piano. Composing music allows me to express creativity while balancing my analytical pursuits in computer science. I also compose electronic music using both analog and digital audio workstations, experimenting with sound design and blending genres to create unique compositions.<br /></li>
<li>I am passionate about maintaining bioactive terrariums, where I have been keeping two colonies of isopods in a self-sustaining environment for over 3 years. This hobby reflects my interest in ecology and sustainable systems. Additionally, I have rescued and care for a bearded dragon, providing it with a safe and enriched habitat.<br /></li>
<li>Two writers I deeply admire are Umberto Eco and Hermann Hesse. Their books, especially The Island of the Day Before and Siddhartha, have been meaningful to me —in different ways— and have shaped how I think about life, spirituality, philosophy, and personal growth.<br /></li>
